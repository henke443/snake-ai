# Snake AI
Snakes with brains that learn by genetic algorithms to eat other snakes.

Being the first thing I've ever done in rust, and still work in progress,
this probably sucks. I don't expect anyone to ever stumble upon this as I've
never really done anything on github and wont advertise this anywhere. However,
feel free to download and look at it, just have rust installed and write
`cargo run --release` in the project directory.

## TODO
I will create another game which learns by NEAT instead, and I will write
better more idiomatic rust with more tests

Love rust so far.
